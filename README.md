# Simple filtered encode for animes
A simple filtered encode for animes not in native 1080p production with vapoursynth r65.

## Goal: Try to get a better image quality
From a video source, my goal is just to clean artefacts as simple as possible in an anime episode.

You can download here [my portable vapoursynth pack](https://kdrive.infomaniak.com/app/share/859085/d0539b34-20d6-423b-a0d4-5b9d1c5f1016) to test the filtered encode.

Here is a quick [comparison](https://slow.pics/c/uNrV6CMZ) of the results.

*About me: Just a newbie in filtering, coding, etc.*

Pros:
- Using the least greedy filters
- Using as few filters as possible
- Can work mostly with decent animations

Cons:
- Cannot deal with big animation issues (big aliasing, big banding, etc.)
- Not very flexible
- Can introduce unexpected artefacts (rarely or not enough visible during playback)
- Encode can be very slow
- (I don't know what else)
