# Simple filtered encode for animes
A simple filtered encode for animes not in native 1080p production with vapoursynth r62

Pros:
- Better than the source
- Can work mostly with decent animations

Cons:
- Cannot deal with big animation issues (big aliasing, big banding, etc.)
- (I don't know what else)
